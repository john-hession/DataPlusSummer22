Summer 2022 Data+ Project 6, Policy Surveillance of UHC Financing in Developing nations

A team of students led by researchers at the Duke Center for Policy Impact in Global Health (CPIGH) will create a user-friendly interactive visualization tool to track the evolution of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) financing policies in the low- and middle-income countries. This publicly available data visualization will provide an opportunity for policymakers and researchers to conduct a quick comparative cross-country analysis and longitudinal analysis to understand the impact of different policy experiments on UHC progress in different jurisdictions.
