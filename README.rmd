Summer 2022 Data+ Project 6, Policy Surveillance of UHC Financing in Developing nations

A team of students led by researchers at the Duke Center for Policy Impact in Global Health (CPIGH) will create a user-friendly interactive visualization tool to track the evolution of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) financing policies in the low- and middle-income countries. This publicly available data visualization will provide an opportunity for policymakers and researchers to conduct a quick comparative cross-country analysis and longitudinal analysis to understand the impact of different policy experiments on UHC progress in different jurisdictions. Global Health, Public Policy, Finance.

Things to do:

Data:
-Figure out how to automate pulling data out of MonQcle.
-Make data script auto update csv in git.

Map:
-Standardize color scales
-Add date slider
  -Need to figure out how to make multiple callback functions affect the map.
  -Need to account for nonexistent longitudinal data.
  -Maybe reduce to year? That would make it easier, esp when mananging map of many countries.

Organization:
-Reformat app layout with bootstrap, will make future elements and page layout easier to organize.

Everything Else:
-Everything: All the other graphics, about page, country/policy search page, comparison tool
-Embedding in other sites??? Emdedding(easily) is a dash enterprise feature, and we don't have time to create that feature ourselves.
-It is not possible to make something that automatically adds new codebook elements. There has to be some degree of active maintence.
-Can someone just show me how they put the MonQcle maps in LawAtlas? That fixes the date slider and embedding problems, and the problems with getting data out of
MonQcle.
